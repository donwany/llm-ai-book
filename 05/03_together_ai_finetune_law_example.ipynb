The interface you build will have to use these special sequences like `</s>` and `[/INST]` to extract out the model's responses and input back into the model the growing history of conversational turns.

The court reasoned that a government company undertaking public functions qualifies as 'State' based on factors like government control, public importance of activities etc. This interpretation was based on previous decisions that have defined 'State' under Article 12 broadly to include various agencies and instrumentalities beyond just statutory bodies. The court also applied the principle that unreasonable and arbitrary contractual terms can be struck down under Article 14 of the Constitution. The court found that Rule 9(i) of the service rules, which allowed for termination of service without reason, conferred unfettered power to terminate employment without hearing. This was deemed arbitrary and violative of principles of natural justice and right to equality under Article 14. Furthermore, the court held that the right to life and livelihood under Article 21 is affected by arbitrary termination of employment.

The court reasoned that a government company undertaking public functions qualifies as 'State' based on factors like government control, public importance of activities etc. This interpretation was based on previous decisions that have defined 'State' under Article 12 broadly to include various agencies and instrumentalities beyond just statutory bodies. The court also applied the principle that unreasonable and arbitrary contractual terms can be struck down under Article 14 of the Constitution. The court found that Rule 9(i) of the service rules, which allowed for termination of service without reason, conferred unfettered power to terminate employment without hearing. This was deemed arbitrary and violative of principles of natural justice and right to equality under Article 14. Furthermore, the court held that the right to life and livelihood under Article 21 is affected by arbitrary termination of employment. The court reasoned that the right to livelihood is an integral part of the right to life, and any arbitrary action that affects a person's livelihood would be a violation of Article 21.In conclusion, the court's legal reasoning was based on a broad interpretation of the term 'State', the application of the principle of equality and natural justice under Article 14, and the protection of the right to life and livelihood under Article 21. </s>\"}\n"

Firstly, the court held that Article 14 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees the right to equality, can apply to contractual terms between State entities and private parties if found arbitrary. This means that even though the employees were not government servants under the definition provided under Article 12, their service conditions could still be subject to constitutional scrutiny. Secondly, the court emphasized that Article 14 does not require proof of malice or mala fides for a termination to be deemed arbitrary. Instead, it is enough to show that the termination violates the principle of reasonableness and non-arbitrariness. Thirdly, the court rejected the doctrine of 'State instrumentality' as a valid defense against writ jurisdiction, stating that an entity will be considered 'State' only if there is deep and pervasive governmental control in its functioning and financing. Lastly, the court clarified that the right to livelihood under Article 21 is affected by arbitrary termination of employment. Therefore, .....`\n",
